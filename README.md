## Mod 1 Project: Majik Turn

It is my first large project that I have came up by myself and gotten help from multiple sources and people. This project is just the starting line for what i will create in the future. As such here is my game a quick 7-rounds turn based evolved Rock-Paper-Scizzors game in RPG fanatsy.


## Small inspiration to create it in the first place

This was inspired by a simple game of rock, paper, scizzors, that me and my cousin used to play and made it into our own version of it. It was a lot more complicated than this in terms or game rules and gameplay. However it was a good time all around so i somewhat want to relate to it somehow. In addition to that I just like fanatsy and sci-fi genre.

## Gameplay 

This is a more developed version of rock paper scizzors. It has more options to chose from and instead of use rock, paper, or scizzors we use magic. The spells you can cast is Electricity, Void/Space, Water, Fire, and lastly Earth. The effectiveness chart will be shown at a later date (Must be drawn/transcribed into pc )

## The Digital Structure of the Project

First off the terms of Importance of each file goes in order in my opinion is html or javascript, then css. As such html and Javascript were the first files I created

## Difficulties I had with my program 

1. My first problem was in the Javascript and html where the the eventlistener was working correctly and never was being read.
2. My second problem was with my css where one of the element of the html was overlapping another element.
3. My third problem and most annoying problem was that a whole conditional was being completely ignored.

## Future Improvements

1. First would be a selection option (Menu) to make it a duel (Two player game) or a Golem vs Caster( Computer vs Player)
2. Visuals such as animations on each spell and a soudn effect on a hover on each button all vary with each other.
